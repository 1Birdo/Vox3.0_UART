# üõ†Ô∏è Vox 3.0 UART Shell Access
### (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)

Gain UART shell access on a Vodafone Vox 3.0 router.

----

# üèóÔ∏è Plan

I'm trying to gain access to the device with the goal of either installing a different operating system‚Äîpotentially reimaging it with OpenWRT‚Äîor modifying the existing one.

Additionally, I plan to extract the original firmware to retrieve its built-in web UI dashboard. This could also help uncover potential vulnerabilities or explore basic privilege escalation opportunities within the default shell environment of the original firmware.

This is purely for educational purposes. While it's unlikely that a highly proprietary device from a major corporate ISP would have vulnerabilities, it's not unheard of. Worth a shot, right? ü§∑

```bash
(*I am currently still working on the GoFlood Project but exploring different areas,
Other projects like my Metrics Dashboard via SDKs/Requests is still under-development.
Im also Making improvements / Tweaks to my main page and fixing errors + Implementing my Tools + CS Study page fully)
```

## üì∑ Preview
### UART Access Example:

At 18 seconds, the magic happens as I had to manually reconnect the wires again.

## üìñ Description

This repository documents how to access a UART serial console on the Vodafone Vox 3.0 router, which can provide direct shell access to the underlying Linux system. This can be useful for research, debugging, or developing custom firmware.

> **Note:** This is intended for educational and personal research purposes only. Do not attempt this on devices you do not own or have explicit permission to access.

## üîß What You Need

- A Vodafone Vox 3.0 router
- USB to TTL serial adapter (e.g., CH340, FTDI)
- Soldering tools (if UART pins are not populated)
- Terminal emulator (PuTTY, minicom, screen, etc.)

|-----|-------------|
| GND | Ground      |
| TX  | Transmit    |
| RX  | Receive     |
| VCC | *Do not connect* (usually 3.3V) |
