# üõ†Ô∏è Vox 3.0 UART Shell Access  
### (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)

Gain UART shell access on a Vodafone Vox 3.0 router

---

## üìã Project Overview
This repository documents how to access a UART serial console on the Vodafone Vox 3.0 router, providing direct shell access to the underlying Linux system. Useful for research, debugging, or developing custom firmware.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Intended for educational and personal research only. Only perform on devices you own or have explicit permission to access.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Gain shell access via UART interface
- Extract original firmware for analysis
- Explore potential for:
  - Installing alternative OS (OpenWRT)
  - Modifying existing firmware
  - Discovering vulnerabilities
  - Privilege escalation opportunities

> *"While unlikely that a proprietary ISP device would have vulnerabilities, it's not unheard of. Worth investigating!"*
