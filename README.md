# üèóÔ∏è Plan

I'm attempting to gain access to the device with the goal of either installing a different operating system‚Äîpotentially reimaging it with OpenWRT‚Äîor modifying the existing one.

Additionally, I plan to extract the original firmware to retrieve its built-in web UI dashboard. This could also help uncover potential vulnerabilities or explore basic privilege escalation opportunities within the default shell environment of the original firmware.

This is purely for educational purposes. While it's unlikely that a highly proprietary device from a major corporate ISP would have vulnerabilities, it's not unheard of. Worth a shot, right? ü§∑

### UART Access Example:

At 18 seconds, the magic happens as I had to manually reconnect the wires again.

## üìñ Description

This repository documents how to access a UART serial console on the Vodafone Vox 3.0 router, which can provide direct shell access to the underlying Linux system. This can be useful for research, debugging, or developing custom firmware.

> **Note:** This is intended for educational and personal research purposes only. Do not attempt this on devices you do not own or have explicit permission to access.
